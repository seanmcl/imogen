variable matching.  This unification problem is unitary.
Then we solve the AC1 world unification problem of the pi, qi.
Since pi,qi can have constants (the parameters are effectively
constants in this setting), we no longer have unique mgus.  For
example, c ≡ α1 ⋆ α2 has 2 solutions, { α1 ↦ c, α2 ↦ ε }
and { α1 ↦ ε, α2 ↦ c }.  A full solution involves translating
the problem into nonhomogenous diophantine equations and solving
those.  The problem is NP-complete, and a bit of a mess.

Instead, we will try to find an i such that the problem
pi ⋆ qi ≡ pi' ⋆ qi' is unitary.  Then we can apply the
substitution to the rest of the equations and hope that
the substitution generates more unitary equations.  If
not, we will maintain the non-unitary equations as constraints.

0) remove all ε from Δ
 p ⋆ ε ↦ p

1) if α ≡ p ∈ Δ or p ≡ α ∈ Δ
 Δ ↦ {α ↦ p} (Δ \ {α ≡ p})
 Add {α ↦ p} to θ

2) If p ≡ ε ∈ Δ or ε ≡ p ∈ Δ and ç ∈ p, fail.

3) If p ≡ ε ∈ Δ or ε ≡ p ∈ Δ and p = α1 ⋆ ⋯ ⋆ αn
 Δ ↦ {α1 ↦ ε, …, αn ↦ ε} (Δ \ {p ≡ ε})
 Add {α ↦ ε, …, αn ↦ ε} to θ

4) If an equation ρ has the form ç ⋆ p1 ≡ ç ⋆ p2, or
 α ⋆ p1 ≡ α ⋆ p2 then replace ρ with p1 ≡ p2

5) If an equation ρ has the form ç1 ⋆ ⋯ ⋆ çn ≡ ç ⋆ p, (and by rule 5 none
 of the çi appear in p) then fail.

6) If an equation ρ has the form α ⋆ çs ≡ αs ⋆ çs', where there are no
 variables in çs and |çs| > 0, then {α ↦ α' ⋆ çs'} where α' is a new variable.
 (Recall that by now çs ∩ çs' = ∅)

7) Otherwise, either ρ has the form
 ç1 ⋆ ⋯ ⋆ çn ≡ αs
 where αs consists of at least two variables
 or both sides of ρ has one of the following forms
 α1 ⋆ α2 ⋆ w, α ⋆ ç ⋆ w
 In this case, we return ρ as a constraint.
