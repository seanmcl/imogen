- Remove ..  Don't be lazy!

- remove Atoms

- Variables are being created during world unification.  I'm just slapping the world sort
  on any variables not in the context.  Make this nicer.

- clean up globals.  now there are types for the variables that came up during focusing.

- delete sequents with c ⋆ c 

- delete sequents with p Ⓦ α ⋆ β 

??? p Ⓦ a, q Ⓦ a

- filter-aware contraction

- strengthen (delete) propositions on the left that contain worlds that don't occur on the right

- exploit symmetry to reduce exponential to linear contractions

- Lax

 ○ A ↦ (A ⊃ p) ⊸ p

 Γ, A ⊢ C lax
 ---------------
 Γ, ○ A ⊢ C lax 

 Γ ⊢ C true
-------------
 Γ ⊢ C lax

 Γ ⊢ C lax
--------------
 Γ ⊢ ○ C true
 
 - How do variables invented during equation solving get assigned sorts?

- Remove duplicate sequents from focus list.  E.g. p ⇔ p gives p ⊢ p twice.
